# Guide on Contributing

Thanks for your interest in cookiecutter-website-infrastructure! I've mostly
updated this project with bits and pieces from other websites that I've made and
maintain. I'm open for any ideas, suggestions, new features, or other
improvements to the project.

There is also this helpful guide on
[How to contribute to an open source project](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

## Bug Reports and New Features

Please contact me if you have found a bug or want to add a new feature. I'm
usually pretty available to help with questions you may have.
